# ATP Tour Matchup Visualization

## Architecture and Technologies
* D3.js for data visualization
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the frontend and Node.js on the backend
* Data files formatted from CSV

## Background and Overview
A visualization of head-to-head statistics between professional tennis players, organized by year.

## Demo

## Implementation
- Formulated a custom hierarchical edge bundling design using the D3 library to visualize win-loss ratios in a single tournament season, to highlight the sportâ€™s record-breaking years.
- Authored algorithms for responsive search result highlighting triggered by changes to user input, to provide an intuitive and lively UX.
- Created a custom CSV file parser to aggregate statistics between nodes, compile relational data, and render the tree, allowing for usage of multiple datasets.

# Visualization of highest win-loss ratios by year


## Future Plans 
- A synopsis render of subsequent match statistics for the year when selecting a player.
- Compare the yearly results of multiple players with selectors/filters.
- In-depth analysis of a single player's results based on court surface specialty (hard, grass, clay).
