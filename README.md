# ATP Tour Matchup Visualization

## Architecture and Technologies
* D3.js for data visualization
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the frontend and Node.js on the backend
* Data files formatted from CSV

## Background and Overview
A visualization of head-to-head statistics between professional tennis players, organized by year and an entire tournament season of the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals). 

## Demo

## Implementation
- Formulated a custom hierarchical edge bundling design using the D3 library to visualize win-loss ratios in a single tournament season, to highlight the sportâ€™s record-breaking years.
- Authored algorithms for responsive search result highlighting triggered by changes to user input, to provide an intuitive and lively UX.
- Created a custom CSV file parser to aggregate statistics between nodes, compile relational data, and render the tree, allowing for usage of multiple datasets.

## Custom CSV Parser 
The parser extracts the selected data set from an memoized object to prepare a root node and begin to build relationships between data nodes.
```javascript
  d3.csv(rawData[year], function (error, data) {
    if (error) throw error;
  
    // Create an object with players and their opponents
    let playersAndOpponents = {};
    data.forEach((datum) => {
      if (datum.loser_name !== 'undefined' || datum.winner_name !== 'undefined') {
        playersAndOpponents[datum.winner_name] = playersAndOpponents[datum.winner_name] || [];
        playersAndOpponents[datum.winner_name].push(datum.loser_name);
      }
    })
    
    // Parse the data
    let importData = [];
    for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(playersAndOpponents)) {
      let entryObj = { "name": `${key}`, "imports": `${value}` }
      entryObj.imports = entryObj.imports.split(',')
      importData.push(entryObj);
    }
  
    // Prepare the root
    let root = packageHierarchy(importData)
    cluster(root);
    ...
   }
```

## Future Plans 
- A synopsis render of subsequent match statistics for the year when selecting a player.
- Compare the yearly results of multiple players with selectors/filters.
- In-depth analysis of a single player's results based on court surface specialty (hard, grass, clay).
